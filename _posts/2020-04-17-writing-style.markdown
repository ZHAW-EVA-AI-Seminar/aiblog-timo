As mentioned in the previous blog-post, I'll analyze the paper [Temporal Pyramid Pooling Convolutional Neural Network for Cover Song Identification](https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/2019/0673.pdf) throught the coming weeks. In this blog post I would like to talk about the general style of it. How is it written, structured and presented. 

In general, I found the paper to be of fairly good quality. It is clearly structured into sections and subsections, the figures and tables are properly prepared, labled and not overloaded.
The paper is a conference paper for the international joint conference on artificial intelligence. It assumes the reader has some background in the domain of artificial intelliegence and it skips explanation of the concepts from that domain. Expressions from the domain of cover song identification are however well explained, step by step, so that the reader can follow. 

The abstract starts with "`Cover song identification is an important problem in the field of Music Information Retrival`" and continues describing applied methods/results. The introduction explains the problem of cover song identification really well. After reading the introduction section it becomes clear, what the problem is actually about and what makes it hard.

Related work is well summarized, but precise reasons why the previous solutions didn't work are often skipped with sentences like "`these methods achieve promising results but require further improvement`". What differs between existing and the presented solution is however clearly described.

I like the main body of the paper: It explains the developed method in detail and is clear and precise about it. What comes a bit short again, is the explanation of why things have been built the way they have. Another shortcoming in my opinion, is that the authors assume the reader is completely familiar with the topic of Temporal Pyramid Pooling. According to Google Scholar, [the paper that introduces the topic](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7484698) is cited by 80 other papers, which in my opinion does not make it a well known paper. It would have been nice, if the authors explained the topic briefly, especially since quite a large portion of the described method depends on it.

The benchmarking settings and results are also described in great detail. The comparison to previous work is clear and easy to follow. Also, the authors included an error analysis.

Overall I really like the clear structure and precise wording of the paper. Another plus is, that the authors put the source code of their work online, so that the readers can play with it. I think the authors put quite a lot of work in it, to get the paper on that level. However, the mentioned shortcomings are in my opinion quite severe and should be fixed in order to increase the quality even more.
