During the past weeks, I've blogged about cover song identification. During that time, I took a seminar in my master studies, where we talked about scientific writing and reviewing. As this seminar now comes to an end, it is time to critically self assess my performance. Critical self-assessment is, in general, an essential part of the scientific domain and important even in life itself.

Initially, I set myself the following goals for this seminar:

* Gain knowledge in the field of Music Information Retrieval using artificial intelligence.
* Learn how to analyze papers critically
* Discuss best practices when creating own papers

I can say in good conscience that I have reached these goals. During my work on the cover song identification paper, I had to do a lot of background reading. I took me quite some time to refresh my knowledge of neuronal networks, let alone getting started in the field of cover song identification. Now I have a basic understanding of the domain of cover song identification and the related topics. In the seminar sessions, we talked in detail about how to read, review and write scientific content. I found the sessions to be pretty thorough and always interesting. My two main learnings from the sessions are:
* How to put a paper in context and find relevant accompanying literature and related topics. 
* How to read a paper. I now know what to pay attention to, and what authors might focus on, apart from documenting their work (e.g. passing a paper review).

I think I also improved in expressing my own view. Before the seminar, I found it pretty challenging to criticize scientific work in a domain that I'm no expert in. Now I'm able to criticize others work, even if I don't know everything about that domain, by factoring in my level of knowledge and clearly expressing the limitations and the bias of my review. 

As far as the writing goes, I think that I learned to pay more attention to detail. Reading the own text with the eyes of potential reader helps to spot potential holes and open questions. Moreover, I think my grammar improved in general, but there's still room for improvement here.

My initial motivation for the seminar was high, and I think I kept that motivation, at least for the meeting sessions. Writing the blog-posts and working on the paper was more challenging since my time was fairly limited. I usually spent around 2-4 hours on writing a blog-post. I always knew that I could deliver a better blog post if I invested more time in it, but that was just not possible with my schedule. So I always perceived that the quality of my work fell a bit short. For instance, I usually assumed the target audience of my blog posts to be only the participants of the seminar, although the real audience might be larger and different. Also, I did not pay too much attention to avoid personal pronouns, avoid passive sentences or think about the optimal structure of my post before starting to write it.

But in general, I'm quite happy with what I've achieved with the time I've invested. If I were to compare my performance of the blog-posts with the other participants of the seminar, I would create the following ranking list in descending order:

* Sebastian's Blog Posts are of excellent quality. His posts were always very detailed and typically longer than mine. The structure was always well thought. I assume that the fact that he put the blog posts on his personal blog and plans to continue his blog after the seminar allowed him to put more time in it. As a reader, I could really feel that it was not just an assignment for him.
* My Blog posts are okay. But as mentioned above, the quality and level of detail could be improved. I was usually one of the first to post my blog post for the session, and I think sometimes the others copied some thoughts regarding the structure from me, except Sebastian, who always had a different structure. 
* Marco's Blog Post I found to be generally a bit shorter and of a tiny bit lesser quality than mine. However, I think he also invested less time, which makes it okay again. 
* Bibiya's and Adnan's Blog Post I would put on the same level, a bit below Marco's. Their blog posts usually arrived very last-minute, and to me, it felt like the time was even more pressing for them, so the results fell a bit short sometimes.

I think for future iterations of this seminar, the lecturer should talk about the expected time investment. This would allow for a better comparison between the work of the students.

I'm glad I took this seminar, and I would retake it. I'm also looking forward to the other seminar of a similar kind next semester (Machine Intelligence Lab).
